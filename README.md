<ul>
<li>Creating a new repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Cloning the repository</li>
<li>Using git commands (add, commit, and push)</li>
<li>Creating an HTML boilerplate</li>
<li>Creating headings and paragraphs</li>
<li>Creating relative links</li>
<li>Creating unordered and ordered lists</li>
<li>Adding an image with appropriate alt text and image size attributes</li>
<li> Applying the knowledge of flex</li>
<li> using CSS to style the project to make it more presentable</li>
<li>Publishing my Landing Page website to be accesible to others via the web</li>
</ul>
